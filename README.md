# SingleID plugin for Wordpress

Version 1.1.5


## What is SingleID

SingleID is a open-source way to facilitate the exchange of attributes between users and websites.
As long as we can define identity as a set of attributes related to an entity, we believe that the best way to exchange identity attributes doesn't involve account creation with strong password or using a keyboard to do some monkey form-filling work.

Our solutions is: Save your data once inside your smartphone and give a read access to whoever requests it each time.

We take care to develop the plugin for any platform who wants to reach your smartphone. And you will never bothered again from complex password and form filling.
