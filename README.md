## What is SingleID

SingleID is a open-source way to facilitate the exchange of attributes between users and websites.
We believe that, as long as we can define identity as a set of attributes related to an entity, the best way to exchange these attributes must not involve account creation with password.

Our solution is:
Saves data once inside your smartphone and give a read access to whoever requests it each time.

We will take care to develop the plugin for any websites and platforms who wants be able to reach your smartphone. And you will never bothered again from complex passwords to remember or to do any form-filling.
